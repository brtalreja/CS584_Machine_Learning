Mastered the concept of regression, a fundamental technique for predicting numerical outcomes based on input features. Topics covered included linear regression, polynomial regression, and regularization techniques such as Ridge and Lasso regression.

## Classification

Explored classification algorithms, their applications, and the process of training models to categorize data into predefined classes. Techniques covered included logistic regression, support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest neighbors (KNN), and decision trees.

## Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Studied the architecture and applications of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in image recognition and computer vision. Topics included convolutional layers, pooling layers, activation functions, and popular CNN architectures like VGG, ResNet, and Inception.

## Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Explored the structure and use cases of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data analysis. Covered the basics of RNNs, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), focusing on their applications in natural language processing and time series prediction.

## Deep Neural Networks (DNN)

Gained an understanding of deep neural networks (DNNs), including their architecture, training processes, and applications. Topics included feedforward neural networks, backpropagation, gradient descent, and the importance of activation functions.

## Transfer Learning

Investigated transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models for new tasks. Covered the benefits of transfer learning, common pre-trained models (e.g., VGG, ResNet), and practical applications in various domains.
